# Public Transport Patronage EDA

Welcome to the Public Transport Patronage EDA repository! In this project, we conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing daily public transport patronage data. The dataset includes information on different types of tickets, such as MyWay cards and paper tickets, excluding those purchased from Ticket Vending Machines. Additionally, patronage for special events is excluded from the dataset.

## Processes and Tasks:

1. **Data Acquisition**: The first step involves acquiring the dataset containing public transport patronage data. This dataset may be sourced from relevant transportation authorities or agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining such data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The core of this project revolves around conducting EDA on the cleaned dataset. During this phase, we explore various aspects of the data to gain insights and understand underlying patterns and trends. Key tasks include:
   - Analyzing the distribution of different ticket types (e.g., MyWay cards vs. paper tickets).
   - Examining temporal trends in patronage over time, including seasonal variations.
   - Identifying correlations between different ticket types and other relevant factors.
   - Creating informative visualizations to illustrate findings and facilitate data interpretation.

3. **Key Insights and Recommendations**: Based on the insights gained from the EDA, we summarize key findings and provide actionable recommendations. These recommendations may be directed towards transportation authorities, policymakers, or other stakeholders involved in public transport management and planning.

4. **Documentation and Reporting**: Throughout the project, comprehensive documentation is maintained to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the analysis. This includes writing an EDA report detailing the methodology, findings, and recommendations.

By following these processes and tasks, we aim to derive meaningful insights from the public transport patronage data, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of transportation services and infrastructure planning. Feel free to explore the repository and engage with the analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and its implications. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we strive for data-driven excellence in public transport management.
